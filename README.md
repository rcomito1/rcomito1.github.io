# Code Portfolio
As a CIT minor at the University of Oregon, I have created many projects as a way for me to practice and prove the all the things I have learned.
Some of my learning outcomes are:
- A web API or Application Programming Interface is an API accessed using the HTTP protocol. Web APIs often deliver data formatted as JSON
- A web API can be accessed programmatically using JavaScript. The API documentation must first be consulted in order to understand how the API works and what it returns.
- Use jQuery to post AJAX requests asynchronously.
- Use the Postman app to test API requests/responses.
- Use NodeJS and Express for a testing server.
- Use jQuery, JavaScript, and public APIs to fetch JSON data, then use it to refresh part of a web page.


## Deployment
As part of this project, we deployed our web app to UOregon.edu.
